Project in Java - Processing sketchbook software. 
Made for UPV University subject - Image Synthesis.
There is no framework, there is only code, Java, Java like. 
Geometry, stars, logics, random position, the hardest - inertia, weightlessness even the graphics. Maybe only 150 lines but of true hell.

To play this game you need to install processing. Start the falcon heavy sketch and on the folder which will create paste in the stars. Voila, can you land it? Enjoy
Web version ... soon
