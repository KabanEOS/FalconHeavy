Project in Java - Processing sketchbook software. 
Made for UPV University subject - Image Synthesis.
There is no framework, there is only code, Java, Java like. 
Geometry, stars, logics, random position, the hardest - inertia, weightlessness even the graphics. Maybe only 150 lines but of true hell.
